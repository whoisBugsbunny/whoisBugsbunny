I'm a regular guy who stumbled into the awesome world of WEB Design and now spends his days crafting gorgeous websites with pure CSS and JS, pushing commits to make the digital world a little more beautiful.

Constantly get hit by bugs.

By day, I craft websites. By night, I dive into anime, battle over the chessboard, write fiction and study Japanese to one day watch anime without subtitles (日本語を勉強しています - Nihongo o benkyō shite imasu).

Also, I’m a proud member of the “Jack of all trades, master of none” club — always learning, always experimenting.

Beyond the lines of code, you can find me
- Lost in the captivating **worlds and art style of anime**
- Slowly deciphering **Hiragana & Katakana**
- AI took over my Art skills, so now I **Write Books**
- Lost in **Space** (shoutout **Neil** deGrasse Tyson!)
- locked in strategic battles on the **Chessboard** being **BM** ~(Blunder Master)~
- Also, I'm on my quest to *eventually* become **Omniscient** or maybe just **Galvan** species 👽
