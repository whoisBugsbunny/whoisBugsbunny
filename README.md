# Hello World! 👋 I'm Ankit Sharma (whoisBugsbunny)

💻 just a Programmer | 🌐 Web Enthusiast | (˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶) Anime Fan | ♟️ Chess Player (BM) | 🧠 Aspiring Omniscient or Galvan | 🎌 Adding Japanese in my Polyglot Arsonal

I'm a regular guy who stumbled into the awesome world of WEB Design and now spends his days crafting gorgeous websites with pure CSS and JS, constantly pushing commits to make the digital world a little more beautiful.

By day, I craft websites. By night, I dive into anime, battle over the chessboard, and study Japanese to one day watch anime without subtitles(日本語を勉強しています - Nihongo o benkyō shite imasu).

Also, I’m a proud member of the “Jack of all trades, master of none” club — always learning, always experimenting.

## 🛠️ My Developer Toolkit

Here are some of the technologies and tools I wield:

**Languages I Speak:**
`HTML` | `CSS` | `JavaScript` | `EJS` | `NodeJS` | `Java` | `SQL`

**Frameworks & Libraries I Play With:**
`Firebase` | `MongoDB` | `Swing` | `React` | `Flutterfire`

**Tools & Platforms I Navigate:**
`Git` | `AWS (noob)` | `Netlify` | `VS Code` | `IntelliJ` | `Hyper`

## 📺 When I'm Not Conquering Code...

Beyond the lines of code, you can find me
- Lost in the captivating worlds of anime
- Lost in Space (shoutout Neil deGrasse Tyson!)
- locked in strategic battles on the Chessboard being BM (Blunder Master)
- Slowly deciphering Hiragana & Katakana
- Also, I'm on my quest to *eventually* become Omniscient or maybe just Galvan species 👽

## ♟️ My Chess Adventures (and Misadventures!)

Currently trying my best not to blunder pieces and aiming high:

* **Lichess:** [@aekit](https://lichess.org/@/aekit) (Hanging out around 1450 in Rapid, with my sights set on breaking that stubborn 1500 ceiling!)
* **Chess.com:** [aekit](https://www.chess.com/member/aekit) (My rapid journey stuck at 1173, what kind of demons play on this platform!)
* **Lishogi:** [@aekit](https://lishogi.org/@/aekit) (Brand new Shogi noob. Shikamaru kind of dragged me here... what a drag!)
